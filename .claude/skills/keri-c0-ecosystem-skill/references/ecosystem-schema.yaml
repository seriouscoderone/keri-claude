# KERI Ecosystem Schema
# Canonical template for defining an industry ecosystem restructured around
# KERI-native verifiable relationships. This file is populated by the
# /keri-c0-ecosystem workflow and consumed by downstream C1-C4 skills.
#
# Example comments use the insurance industry for illustration.

version: "1.0"

ecosystem:
  # Machine-readable identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
  name: ""              # e.g., "insurance"
  # Human-readable label
  display_name: ""      # e.g., "Insurance Industry Ecosystem"
  # One-paragraph description of the ecosystem scope

  # How disputes are resolved in this ecosystem

roles:
  # Each role represents a category of participant in the ecosystem.
  # Roles map industry concepts to KERI infrastructure obligations.

  #   description: "Licensed insurance company that underwrites policies"
  #   keri_infrastructure:
  #     witness_pool: true       # Operates own witness pool

  #     agent_service: true      # Runs KERIA agent
  #     acdc_registry: true      # Maintains credential registry
  #   governance_obligations:
  #     - "Must maintain witness pool with >= 3 witnesses"
