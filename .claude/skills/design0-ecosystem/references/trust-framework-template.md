# {{ecosystem_display_name}} -- Trust Framework

> Governance specification for the **{{ecosystem_name}}** ecosystem.
> Defines who participates, what credentials exist, how authority is delegated,
> and what obligations each role carries. Generated by `/keri:design0-ecosystem`.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The {{ecosystem_display_name}} trust framework establishes a KERI-native governance model for the {{ecosystem_name}} industry. It replaces centralized trust intermediaries with cryptographically verifiable relationships using Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs), and delegated authority hierarchies.

**Scope:** {{ecosystem_description}}

**Regulatory basis:** {{governance_regulatory_frameworks}}

## 2. Governance Authority

### 2.1 Governing Body

{{governance_authority_narrative}}

### 2.2 Regulatory Frameworks

{{#each governance.regulatory_frameworks}}
- **{{this}}**
{{/each}}

### 2.3 Framework Versioning

This trust framework is versioned. Changes to credential schemas, role definitions, or delegation rules require a new version published to the ecosystem's schema registry. Participants MUST verify framework version before issuing or accepting credentials.

## 3. Participant Roles

### 3.1 Role Summary

| Role | Display Name | Witness Pool | Watcher Network | Agent Service | ACDC Registry |

## 4. Credential Governance

### 4.1 Issuance Rules

Each credential type has a designated issuer role. Only AIDs holding the required role credential may issue that credential type. Issuance MUST:

- Validate the issuer holds a current, unrevoked role credential
- Verify schema compliance before signing
- Anchor the TEL issuance event in the issuer's KEL
- Collect witness receipts meeting the ecosystem's threshold

### 4.2 Revocation Policies

- Issuers MAY revoke credentials they have issued at any time
- Revocation is immediate upon TEL `rev` event anchored in the issuer's KEL
- Governance body MAY mandate revocation for policy violations
- Revoked credentials MUST NOT be accepted by verifiers

### 4.3 Dispute Resolution

{{governance_dispute_resolution}}

Duplicity (equivocation) detected by watchers constitutes automatic grounds for credential suspension. The governance body convenes a judge/jury panel to evaluate duplicity evidence and render a binding judgment.

---

## 5. Infrastructure Obligations

### 5.1 Witness Pool Requirements

Roles operating witness pools MUST:
- Maintain a minimum of 3 geographically distributed witnesses
- Achieve KAACE consensus threshold before confirming events
- Publish OOBI endpoints for witness discovery
- Monitor witness availability and rotate failed witnesses

### 5.2 Watcher Network Requirements

Roles subscribing to watcher networks MUST:
- Sync KELs for all AIDs they interact with
- Report duplicity evidence to the governance body
- Maintain first-seen records for audit purposes

### 5.3 Agent Service Requirements

Roles running KERIA agents MUST:
- Secure private key material (never at rest on disk unencrypted)
- Implement key rotation on a schedule defined by the governance body
- Maintain backup and recovery procedures
- Support the IPEX protocol for credential exchange

---

## 6. Privacy Framework

### 6.1 Disclosure Modes

{{#each credential_catalog}}
- **{{name}}**: {{disclosure_mode}} disclosure
{{/each}}

### 6.2 Data Minimization

Verifiers MUST request only the minimum credential fields required for their purpose. Selective disclosure credentials MUST be presented in compact form unless the verifier demonstrates a legitimate need for full disclosure.

### 6.3 Consent

Credential holders control presentation. No credential may be verified without the holder initiating the IPEX presentation exchange. The holder's agent MUST prompt for consent before disclosing attributes.

### 6.4 Privacy Requirements

{{#each governance.privacy_requirements}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

---

## 7. Liability Framework

### 7.1 Issuer Liability

Credential issuers are liable for the accuracy of claims at the time of issuance. Issuers MUST revoke credentials when underlying facts change.

### 7.2 Verifier Liability

Verifiers are liable for checking revocation status and duplicity evidence before relying on a credential.

### 7.3 Holder Liability

Holders are liable for maintaining key security. Compromise of a holder's keys does not invalidate properly-issued credentials but requires immediate key rotation and re-issuance.

### 7.4 Infrastructure Liability

Witness pool operators are liable for availability and first-seen integrity. Watcher operators are liable for timely duplicity reporting.

## 8. Interoperability

{{#each interoperability}}

### {{target_ecosystem}} Bridge

**Bridge credentials:** {{bridge_credentials}}

**Data flows:**
{{#each data_flows}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

{{/each}}

Cross-ecosystem credential verification requires both ecosystems to publish compatible OOBIs and recognize each other's governance frameworks. Bridge credentials MUST chain from a credential recognized in both ecosystems.

## Next Steps

- Run `/keri:design1-service` to design services within this ecosystem
- Credential schemas in `credential-catalog.md` define the ACDC `a` block for each type
- Infrastructure patterns are selected at C2 based on role requirements in this document
