# --- Components ---
# The frontend is a thin client that delegates all KERI operations to the
# agent-service stack via the Signify protocol. No C3 domain components
# are required — signify-ts handles signing at the edge.
#
# The LockedIn app:
# 1. Collects presence data (GPS, barometrics, biometrics) from device APIs
# 2. Signs presence events locally using signify-ts
# 3. Submits signed events to the agent-service API
# 4. Requests selective disclosure proofs from the agent/registry
# 5. Presents proofs to requesters
#
# All KERI protocol logic (KEL management, witness coordination, ACDC
# lifecycle, TEL processing) runs server-side in the agent-service and
# acdc-registry stacks.

# --- Data Structures ---
# Handled by signify-ts library — no domain-level data structures to define.
# The frontend consumes and produces KERI protocol messages but does not
# implement its own event processing.

  language: typescript
  library: signify-ts
  rationale: >-
    Browser/mobile-based signing at the edge. signify-ts handles all
    cryptographic operations client-side — key generation, event signing,
    CESR encoding. Keys never leave the device. The app communicates with
    the agent-service API for server-side KERI operations (witness
    coordination, credential management).
